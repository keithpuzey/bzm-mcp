Operations on Billing.
Actions: 
- calculate_cost_from_config: Calculate the cost of a test based on test configuration and workspace allowance type.
args(dict): Dictionary with the following parameters:
    allowance_type (str, required, valid=["credits", "virtualUserHours", "actualThreads", "serverHours", "functionalRequests"]): The workspace allowance.
    test_type (str, required, default="performance", valid=["performance", "browser_performance", "gui_functional", "api_monitoring", "service_virtualization"]): Type of test.
    concurrency (int, required for performance/browser_performance): Maximum concurrent virtual users/threads.
    duration_minutes (float, required for performance/browser_performance/gui_functional): Test duration in minutes.
    iterations (int, optional, alternative to duration_minutes): Number of iterations.
    browser_sessions (int, required for gui_functional): Number of browser sessions.
    api_calls (int, required for api_monitoring): Number of API calls.
    virtual_services (int, required for service_virtualization): Number of virtual services.
    transactions (int, optional, for service_virtualization): Number of transactions.
    locations (list[str], optional): List of location IDs for load distribution.
    uses_test_data (bool, optional, default=False): Whether test uses BlazeMeter Test Data (adds 50% to cost).
    number_of_servers (int, optional, for serverHours calculation): Number of engines/servers. If not provided, estimated based on concurrency (~1000 users per engine).
Hints:
- The workspace allowance type is automatically determined from the workspace (via 'read' action).
- Supported allowance types: "credits", "virtualUserHours", "actualThreads", "serverHours", "functionalRequests".
- Allowance type details:
  * credits: Tests as Credit (1 credit per test).
  * virtualUserHours: Variable Unit Hours (VUH) as Credit, formerly known as Virtual User Hour.
  * actualThreads: Variable Unit (VU) as Credit - Maximum concurrent threads/units reached (peak concurrency).
  * serverHours: Number of Server Hours - Server/engine hours consumed (engines × duration in hours).
  * functionalRequests: API Functional Tests - Number of API Calls - One unit per API call.
- The 'amount' value within the 'allowance' of a Workspace is how much credit is available. 
- For Performance/Browser Performance tests: provide concurrency and duration_minutes.
- For GUI Functional tests: provide browser_sessions and duration_minutes.
- For API Monitoring tests: provide api_calls.
- For Service Virtualization tests: provide virtual_services and optionally transactions.
- Test Data usage increases cost by 50% for all test types.
- Server hours calculation can use provided number_of_servers or estimate based on concurrency (~1000 users per engine).
- All calculations are based on official BlazeMeter documentation (blazemeter-usage-billing skill).
- **CRITICAL**: Always follow the action schema exactly. If args are required, include args with exact names/types.
